**DESCRIPTION**: This task focuses on automating the login functionality of a web application using Selenium WebDriver in Python. 
The automation handles multiple scenarios, such as entering invalid usernames and ensuring that the correct error messages are displayed clearly on the page. 
It also verifies successful login with valid credentials, ensuring the user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard without any issues. During execution, all outputs are captured in the terminal, providing detailed step-by-step information for easier verification. 
This automation not only validates the login process efficiently but also ensures consistent behavior across multiple test runs successfully and reliably. It helps reduce manual testing effort, improves testing speed, and provides accurate detection of potential login issues, making it easier to maintain the overall quality of the application.
