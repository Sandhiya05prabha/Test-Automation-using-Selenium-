**DESCRIPTION**: This task focuses on automating the login functionality of a sample web application using Selenium WebDriver. 
The automation script launches the browser, navigates to the login page, enters valid credentials, performs login, 
verifies the successful login message, navigates to the dashboard, and then logs out of the application. 
The script also includes basic validation checks to ensure the login process works correctly and the expected 
elements are displayed. This task helps in understanding core Selenium concepts such as locating elements, 
sending inputs, clicking buttons, adding waits, and validating results.
